## Updates

Besides creating the content for my website based on the exampleSite in the original theme repo, I also did some housekeeping removing assets for sections I am not using and some light [CSS](themes/hugo-resume/static/css/resume.css) edits to improve image layout. The `resume-image` class was added to [projects summary](themes/hugo-resume/layouts/partials/projectsSummary.html) and [publications summary](themes/hugo-resume/layouts/partials/publicationsSummary.html). I also changed the Project submenu item "Creation" to "Deployments" in the [index.html](themes/hugo-resume/layouts/index.html) and subdirectory under /content. And there was a limited set of devicons that can be applied to tags in the Skills sections, but I prefer a uniform `</>` delimiter.

## Credits
